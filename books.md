# List of Books that I am Reading or have Read

The following are books that I have read, or am reading, or have abandoned. I'll provide a "tweet" level summary as well in many cases. **Bold** titles indicate books that are particularly impactful.

## 2025

- *Infinite Powers* - Steven Strogatz: This is a fantastic introduction to Calculus (or the application of the infinite) for the lay reader. I wish I would have read this book when I was learning Calculus to get a landscape before going in depth.
- *Children of Time* - Adrian Tchaikovsky: (Reading - so far impressed by the imaginitive world)
- ***The Eighth Day of Creation*** - Horace Freeland Judson (re-reading): This book is a must read for anyone pursuing the sciences, not just the biological ones. It focuses on the process of discovery not just the results. The scientific endeavor is one of perseverance not just brilliance.  

## 2024

- *High Output Management* - Andrew Grove: An insightful read about how to manage teams and operations. May not be applicable under the current culture but still a point of view that is useful to have in your toolbox.

## Undated Books

- *The Plague* - Albert Camus (!) - Simply one of the most powerful books I have ever read. Communicating what it means to be a human and to connect. Life is not about being a saint, but about understanding the condition we all share.
