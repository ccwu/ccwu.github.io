	<h1>Privacy Policies</h1>
	<P>These are the privacy policies for various applications that I have placed in their respective App stores (Apple iOS and Google Play).</P>
  <h2>Tour 1K</h2>
  <p>(Apple iOS App Store and Google Play) Tour 1K does not collect any personal information or require an account to operate. It does not explicitly collect any identfying information from the user. Note that if your version of Tour 1K has advertising displayed, there may be information cross referenced with your device by the ad network serving the ads. The application may also collect usage information for crash reporting and to profile usage.</P>
  <h2>Speech Therapy Practice (STP)</h2>
  <p>(Apple iOS App Store) Speech Therapy Practice does not collect any personal information or require an account to operate. However, on certain iPhone models and/or iOS versions, STP's utilization of Apple's speech recognition feature will send voice and recordings to Apple Inc servers to process the speech and return the recognition content. It does not explicitly collect any identfying information from the user. This application does not conform to HIPAA requirements and is used strictly by the user AS IS understanding the risks of sending data to the public internet.</P>
