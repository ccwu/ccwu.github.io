Welcome to my home on the internet.

Wubashi is a neologism combining languages and meaning. Wu (無) is homonym of my surname (吳) and bashi or "bridge" in Japanese. In short this is a bridge to connect with me. I chose bashi since my trusty bicycle is a Bridgestone which in Japanese is ishibashi. The logo is the Chinese character for nothingness shaped as a foot bridge.
